# Purpose

To demonstrate what is needed to use a local backend with axios requests.
To send requests to backend on local, you need to be able to avoid CORS errors,
for which nginx proxy is used most of the time.
For practice it must be enough to use the localhost proxy.
Don't commit that to production, ok? 

Everything you need is in App.jsx
